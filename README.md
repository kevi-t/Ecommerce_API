## Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip
Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
PostgreSQL or any compatible database
AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI (for deployment)
1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-api.git
                         cd ecommerce-api
2. Set Up Virtual Environment: python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables:
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
5. Run Migrations
python manage.py migrate
6. Run the Development Server
python manage.py runserver
The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

API Endpoints

Authentication
The API uses OAuth2 for authentication. Use /o/token/ for obtaining access tokens.
Testing
Run the following command to execute the unit tests:

python manage.py test
Test Coverage
You can generate a test coverage report using coverage.py:

coverage run manage.py test
coverage report -m
Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is configured to run tests on every push to the repository.

Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file:
yaml
Copy code
name: Django CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv venv
          source venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          source venv/bin/activate
          python manage.py test
Deployment
Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Install AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI

pip install awsebcli
Initialize Elastic Beanstalk

eb init -p python-3.x ecommerce-api --region your-aws-region
Create and Deploy the Environment

bash
Copy code
eb create ecommerce-api-env
eb deploy
Run Database Migrations on AWS

After deploying, run your database migrations on the server:

eb ssh
python manage.py migrate
Open the Application

After deployment is complete, open the application in your browser:

eb open
Environment Variables for AWS
Use the AWS Management Console or the EB CLI to set environment variables in your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Example:

eb setenv SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key DEBUG=False DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

Here's how to update the API Endpoints section in your README.md:

Updated API Endpoints Section:
API Endpoints
Base URL
Local: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
Production: <AWS-ElasticBeanstalk-URL>/api
Postman Collection
To simplify testing the API, you can import the provided Postman collection:

Download the Postman collection file: ecommerce-api-postman-collection.json
Open Postman, click on Import, and select the downloaded .json file.
You will now have access to all the API endpoints with pre-configured requests in Postman.
Example Endpoints
You can use Postman to test the following endpoints:

Customer Service
GET /api/ecommerce/customer/list/: Retrieves a list of all customers.
POST /api/ecommerce/customer/create/: Creates a new customer.
Order Service
GET /api/ecommerce/order/list/: Retrieves a list of all orders.
POST /api/ecommerce/order/create/: Creates a new order.
Account Service
POST /api/ecommerce/account/register/: Registers a new user account.
POST /api/ecommerce/account/login/: Logs in a user and returns an authentication token.
How to Add the Postman Collection
Upload the Postman Collection:

If you're using GitHub, upload your exported Postman collection (.json) to the repository.
Provide a link in the README where it says [ecommerce-api-postman-collection.json](link-to-your-exported-collection).
Share Publicly: If you prefer, you can also share the Postman collection publicly via Postman’s Share Collection feature, generating a shareable link and adding it to your README file instead of the .json.

This updated README helps developers or testers quickly access and use your Postman collection for testing without having to manually configure requests.
